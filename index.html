    <h3><p class="firstpara">An Indian dish made with highly seasoned rice and meat, fish, or vegetables. The spices used in preparing biryani is high, this gives the biryani a richer aroma and texture.</p></h3>
    <h3><p class="secondpara">Biryani is a mixed rice dish originating among the Muslims of the Indian subcontinent. It is made with Indian spices, rice, and meat, and sometimes, in addition, eggs or vegetables such as potatoes in certain regional varieties. Biryani is popular throughout the Indian subcontinent, as well as among its diaspora.</p></h3>
    <h3><p class="secondpara">In a pakki biryani, the rice, marinated meat, and any vegetables are partially ("three-quarters") cooked separately, before being combined into layers in a cooking vessel. Different layers of rice may be treated with different spices (e.g., with dissolved saffron or turmeric give the rice different colors and flavors).The contents are then baked to complete the cooking and allow the flavors to combine (alternatively, the components may be fully cooked, and then simply combined by layering before serving.)</p></h3>
    <h3><p class="secondpara">In a kacchi biryani, layers of raw marinated meat are alternated with layers with wet, pre-soaked, raw rice (which may be treated with different spices as above), and cooked together by baking or medium-to-low direct heat (typically, for at least an hour). Cooking occurs by a process of steaming from the ingredients' own moisture: the cooking vessel's lid is sealed (traditionally, with a strip of wheat dough) so that steam cannot escape. A yoghurt-based marinade at the bottom of the cooking pot provides additional flavor and moisture.</p></h3>

        <h3><p class="bottompara">The different ingredients—meat, rice, potatoes—have different cooking times: tender cuts of meat/chicken can be fully cooked well before the rice is done. To prevent this, many kacchi recipes use parboiled (semi-cooked) rice rather than raw rice.</p></h3>
        <h3><p class="bottompara">If direct heat is used, there is a risk that the food layer in contact with the vessel bottom may get burned while the interior's contents are still raw. This risk is minimized by sustained baking with moderate heat, or very slow cooking on low direct heat. This approach, however, increases cooking time considerably.</p></h3>
        <h3><p class="bottompara">One method is cooking the dish "blind", with the cooking vessel sealed, so one cannot monitor cooking progress—it takes experience to cook a kacchi biryani just right.</p></h3>
        <h3><p class="bottompara">This is an integral part of the Navayath cuisine and a specialty of Bhatkal, a coastal town in Karnataka. Its origins are traced to the Persian traders who left behind not only biryani but a variation of kababs and Indian breads. In Bhatkali biryani, the meat is cooked in an onion and green chili based masala and layered with fragrant rice. It has a unique spicy and heady flavour, and the rice is overwhelmingly white with mild streaks of orange.</p></h3>
        <h3><p class="bottompara">Though similar to those in Thalassery, this biryani differs with lingering after-notes of mashed onions laced with garlic. A few chilies and spices littered with curry leaves lends a unique flavour to Bhatkal biryani. No oil is used.</p></h3>
